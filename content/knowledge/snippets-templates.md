# Templates and snippets

Kumbuka has two reusable-content mechanisms in the server application.

## Page templates

Administrators create named page blueprints. A blueprint can prefill the page path prefix, icon, tags, lifecycle status, owner group, review interval, structured properties, and Markdown body. Authors can choose a blueprint when creating a page.

Blueprints can also declare prompted fields. Each field has a stable name, label, optional default, and optional required flag. Use `{{field:name}}` in the blueprint Markdown; the new-page editor asks for the value, renders it in live preview, and replaces the placeholder when the page is saved. Blueprint fields are creation-time inputs rather than persistent macros.

For example, a service blueprint can provide fields such as `service`, `repository`, and `tier`, pre-assign an owner and `service` tag, and seed properties used by dynamic page reports.

## Knowledge snippets

The bundled **Variables** and **Snippets** plugins provide reusable content referenced by name during page rendering. Manage their data from each plugin detail modal under **Administration → Plugins**:

```text
{{var:name}}
{{snippet:name}}
```

A page can also include another page's Markdown:

```text
{{include:platform/shared-warning}}
{{include:operations/postgres#Restore from backup}}
```

An include can select an ATX heading (`#` through `######`). Kumbuka inserts that heading and its content through the next heading at the same or higher level, so shared runbooks can expose one canonical section without transcluding the complete page.

The bundled **Includes** plugin can nest page includes with recursion protection and a maximum expansion depth. Stored variable and snippet values are inserted without recursively evaluating new plugin macros. Variables and snippets are stored in their plugins; page includes read authorized Kumbuka page content.

## Inspect variables on a page

Resolved values look like ordinary text while reading. A **Variables (N)** button appears in the page actions only when the page expands variables. The count is for distinct stored variables, not occurrences; differently cased references to the same variable share one entry. Variables in included pages are counted too.

Open the panel to see each variable's name, saved value, description, and number of occurrences. **Highlight in page** adds a subtle theme-aware background and a dotted underline to the text originating from a variable. Hover, focus, or tap a highlighted value to inspect its name and saved value. Ordinary text that happens to match the saved value is not highlighted. Turn highlighting off to follow a link whose label contains a highlighted variable.

Closing the panel leaves highlighting active until it is switched off or the page is reloaded. Highlighting never appears in print or PDF output. The panel is read-only: changing shared values remains an administrator action.

Variables used only in link destinations, image attributes, or complex Markdown are still listed, even when there is no text that can be highlighted safely. Kumbuka keeps the normal rendered document whenever annotations would change its content or structure.

## Temporary values for print and PDF

Open **Share and export**, then expand **Customize variables**. Each field starts with its saved value. Change only the fields needed for this output, then use **Preview print / PDF**, **Print**, or **Export PDF**. An intentionally empty field replaces that variable with an empty string; surrounding whitespace is retained. Every occurrence of the same variable receives the same temporary value.

The preview and browser print document use the PDF export's HTML and stylesheet. The preview shows the content, not a pixel-identical simulation of pagination; the browser and PDF service finalize page breaks separately. Like PDF export, the preview uses server-rendered content rather than the reading page's live filters or other browser-only enhancements. Browser print does not require a configured PDF service.

**Reset to saved values** restores the fields and clears the preview. Closing and reopening the dialog starts a fresh session. Overrides are held only for the current dialog/request: they do not update shared variables, page Markdown, revisions, local storage, or another reader's page. A normal browser print action outside this dialog prints the reading page with its saved values. Use the **Print** action in the dialog to print customized values.

Markdown exports remain original source, including macro syntax. This feature does not change macro evaluation: fenced code stays literal, inline code can expand variables, and includes retain their existing recursion limits. Stored snippet contents and temporary values are not recursively evaluated as new knowledge macros.

Temporary values follow the existing Markdown rendering and sanitization rules. Export requests accept at most 128 changed variables, 8 KiB per value, and 64 KiB in total for names and values. Only variables actually used by the page may be overridden. None of these operations writes to the database.
