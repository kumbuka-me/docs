# Static sites

Kumbuka can work like a small MkDocs-style generator: write ordinary Markdown files in a directory and build a complete read-only site without PostgreSQL or a running Kumbuka instance.

This repository's own documentation is configured by `site.toml`; the published Markdown lives under `content/`.

## Build

The standalone Kumbuka CLI contains the read-only browser assets needed by the generator, so it can build a site without the server binary:

```sh
kumbuka-cli build
```

In this documentation repository, the convenience target downloads the pinned Kumbuka CLI and runs the generator:

```sh
make build
```

By default, `kumbuka-cli build` looks for `kumbuka-site.toml`. The configuration file can be changed with `--config`; this repository deliberately uses `site.toml`. When no configuration file is present, `kumbuka-cli` uses `Documentation` as the site name, `docs` as the source directory, and `site` as the output directory. Static presentation defaults to sidebar navigation, comfortable density, and a 280-pixel sidebar. Command-line flags can override the configuration.

## Configuration

A complete `site.toml` can use all of the following settings:

```toml
site_name = "My Documentation"
site_url = "https://docs.example.com/"

source_dir = "content"
output_dir = "site"

theme = "Light"
language = "en"
navigation_style = "sidebar"
navigation_density = "comfortable"
sidebar_width = 280
robots = "allow"

logo = "../branding/logo.svg"
favicon = "../branding/favicon.svg"
favicon_ico = "../branding/favicon.ico"
assets_dir = "../assets"

[[external_links]]
label = "Repository"
url = "https://github.com/example/project"
icon = "github-simple"
description = "v2.4.1"
hover_effect = "lift"
hover_text = "{{label}} | {{description}}"
```

`logo`, `favicon`, `favicon_ico`, and `assets_dir` are resolved relative to the configuration file. Normal relative paths, including `../`, are supported, so assets may live in a parent directory. Absolute paths are supported too. `source_dir` and `output_dir` are resolved relative to the process working directory.

`site_url` determines the URL prefix used by generated links. This matters for project sites such as GitHub Pages, where a site may be hosted below a repository path rather than at the domain root.

`navigation_style` controls the desktop navigation layout and accepts `sidebar` (the default), `topbar`, or `tree`. `navigation_density` accepts `comfortable` (the default) or `compact`. `sidebar_width` sets the navigation width in pixels and must be between 220 and 420; the default is 280. The width is used by sidebar/tree navigation and by the mobile navigation drawer; desktop top-bar navigation does not use it. The same values can be overridden for one build with `--navigation-style`, `--navigation-density`, and `--sidebar-width`.

`robots` controls generated crawler guidance. `allow` writes a `robots.txt` that permits crawling and links to `sitemap.xml` when `site_url` is absolute. `disallow` writes `Disallow: /`, while `none` omits the file entirely. Static builds default to `allow`; the regular Kumbuka application has its own administrator-controlled setting and defaults to `disallow`.

`external_links` adds optional links beside search in the generated header. Each entry requires `label` and an absolute HTTP(S) `url`; `icon` is an optional icon identifier and `description` is optional secondary text such as a version, environment, or provider name. `hover_effect` accepts `highlight` (the default), `lift`, or `none`. `hover_text` customizes the browser tooltip and can contain `{{label}}` and `{{description}}`. Built-in Lucide identifiers use the `-lucide` suffix, for example `book-open-lucide`. The first-party Simple Icons plugin contributes names such as `github-simple`; other `icon-resource` plugins define their own names. Multiple entries are rendered in configuration order.

## Project plugins

Static builds use the project-level `.kumbukaplugins` file to resolve optional rendering and presentation features. The file pins plugin IDs, repositories, tag prefixes, release assets, and versions; `kumbuka-cli build` resolves those packages and selects the declared plugins required by the discovered Markdown and static renderer. The default dependency file is `.kumbukaplugins`; use `--plugins FILE` to select another file for one build.

Manage the file with the CLI instead of downloading package archives by hand:

```sh
kumbuka-cli plugins list
kumbuka-cli plugins sync
kumbuka-cli plugins add \
  --id com.example.chart \
  --repository example/kumbuka-chart \
  --plugin-version 2.3.0
kumbuka-cli plugins remove --id com.example.chart
```

This documentation repository pins its static-site plugins in `.kumbukaplugins`: Subpages renders the section indexes, Tables renders Markdown tables used throughout these pages, Simple Icons supplies the `github-simple` header icon, and Coding Ligatures plus Typographer define the selected text presentation behavior.

## Filesystem routes

Markdown paths map directly to clean static URLs. The source directory must contain a root `index.md`, which becomes the site home page:

```text
docs/index.md                   -> /
docs/getting-started.md         -> /getting-started/
docs/installation/index.md      -> /installation/
docs/installation/docker.md     -> /installation/docker/
```

When `site_url` contains a path prefix, that prefix is prepended to every generated URL.

## Links and assets

Ordinary relative Markdown links are supported:

```markdown
[Docker](installation/docker.md)
```

Kumbuka resolves the source file at build time and rewrites the link to the generated HTML route. A `.md` link to a missing source file fails the build.

Non-Markdown files under the source directory are copied into the output tree. Relative image and asset URLs are rewritten so they continue to work after page routes become directory-style URLs.

Kumbuka wiki links use the same Kumbuka renderer and are rewritten to static routes. Unresolved or ambiguous wiki-link targets fail the build, so a published static site does not silently ship broken Kumbuka links. When the Subpages plugin is declared, `{{subpages}}` reads the filesystem page hierarchy through the static navigation capability and supports the same optional `title="..."` heading override as server-rendered pages.

## Logos, favicons, and extra assets

Branding is entirely opt-in. The builder does not copy Kumbuka logos or favicons into a generated site.

```toml
# These paths are relative to the configuration file.
logo = "assets/logo.svg"
favicon = "content/assets/favicon.svg"
favicon_ico = "content/favicon.ico"
assets_dir = "assets"
```

These path-resolution rules are the same as in the complete configuration example above.

Configured branding files keep a natural public path instead of being renamed:

- a file below `source_dir` keeps its path relative to `source_dir`;
- a file below `assets_dir` is published below `assets/` with the same relative path;
- a branding file outside both trees is published below `assets/` using its own filename;
- `assets_dir` itself is copied recursively below `assets/`, preserving subdirectories and skipping hidden directories.

This documentation repository can publish additional files from the configured `assets_dir`. Branding is opt-in: add `logo`, `favicon`, or `favicon_ico` paths relative to `site.toml` when those files are present.

Logo and favicon images support SVG, PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, and ICO. `favicon_ico` must point to an ICO file; Kumbuka copies images without converting them. Missing paths, incorrect file/directory types, and paths overlapping `output_dir` fail validation before existing output is cleared.

When `logo` is omitted, the header displays `site_name` as text. When `favicon` or `favicon_ico` is omitted, the corresponding icon link is omitted. There is no implicit Kumbuka branding fallback.

Build assets are copied in this order: configured `assets_dir`, the static browser runtime, non-Markdown files from `source_dir`, and explicit branding files. Later copies take precedence. Avoid placing user files at the runtime-owned `assets/js/` and `assets/css/` paths.

For images used inside Markdown, you can continue placing them under `source_dir` and linking with relative paths, such as `![Logo](images/logo.svg)` from the root `index.md`. Do not edit files directly in `output_dir`: each build deletes and recreates it.

## What the build contains

A static build includes:

- generated HTML pages and a `404.html` page;
- the static-site CSS runtime and selected theme data;
- only the read-only TypeScript modules needed for navigation, page contents, Markdown enhancements, and static search;
- no built-in logo, mark, or favicon files unless the user explicitly configures them;
- `search-index.json` for browser-side search;
- source assets such as images;
- `.nojekyll` for GitHub Pages;
- `sitemap.xml` when `site_url` is an absolute HTTP(S) URL;
- `robots.txt` unless `robots = "none"`.

It intentionally does **not** ship the Kumbuka editor, authentication, account menus, admin UI, drafts, notifications, API tokens, or write APIs. The output is ordinary static files and can be hosted by GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, S3-compatible storage, or any web server.

## GitHub Pages

A typical CI job installs `kumbuka-cli`, runs `kumbuka-cli build`, and publishes the generated `site/` directory as the Pages artifact. No PostgreSQL service is needed for that job.

For local preview, override the site URL to match your local server root if the checked-in configuration uses a GitHub Pages project prefix.
