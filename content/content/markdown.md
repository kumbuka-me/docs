# Markdown

Kumbuka uses Goldmark for its core Markdown renderer. Wiki links remain a built-in Kumbuka feature; optional syntax and presentation features such as callouts, tabs, details, tables, task lists, autolinks, syntax highlighting, footnotes, definition lists, and typographic substitutions are provided by plugins and managed under **Administration → Plugins**.

## Images

Use ordinary Markdown image syntax, optionally followed immediately by a width:

```markdown
![Diagram](images/diagram.png){width=640}
![Diagram](images/diagram.png){width=50%}
```

Widths may be whole pixels (with an optional `px` suffix) or a percentage of the containing content area. Height scales proportionally. See [Image sizing](media.md#image-sizing) for limits, reference-style images, and export behavior.

## Wiki links

```markdown
[[Postgres Restore]]
[[Postgres Restore|the runbook]]
[[operations/postgres/restore]]
[[operations/postgres/restore#Verify the restore]]
[[operations/postgres/restore#Verify the restore|verification steps]]
```

Append `#Heading` to link directly to a rendered heading. Heading fragments use the same stable lowercase anchor form as the page renderer, while the page path remains the backlink and broken-link target. Wiki links are ignored inside fenced code blocks.

## Callouts

```markdown
!!! warning
`$(VAR_NAME)` does not work with **envFrom**!
```

Supported presentation kinds include `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `danger`.

## Tabs

````markdown
=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    apt install postgresql
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    brew install postgresql
    ```
````

## Collapsible details

```markdown
??? "Closed by default"

    Markdown content.
```

Use `???+` to render the details block initially open.

## Page functions

The bundled **Subpages** plugin provides a standalone function that inserts the current page's child navigation:

```markdown
{{subpages}}
```

The default heading is **Pages in this section**. Set a custom heading with the `title` option, or use an empty title to hide the heading while keeping the child navigation:

```markdown
{{subpages title="Related pages"}}
{{subpages title=""}}
```

Static builds support the same `{{subpages}}` title behavior when the project declares the Subpages plugin in `.kumbukaplugins`.

## Server-only knowledge macros

The Kumbuka server can expand reusable knowledge content before Markdown rendering:

```text
{{var:name}}
{{snippet:name}}
{{include:path/to/page}}
```

Variables, snippets, and page includes are provided by separate bundled plugins; Includes inserts another page's Markdown. Plugin content expansion is skipped inside fenced code, and includes are recursion-bounded. Disable the corresponding plugin to keep that syntax literal.

See [Tables](tables.md) for Kumbuka's table directive syntax.
