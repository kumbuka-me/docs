# Page lifecycle

Every page has one of four lifecycle states:

| Status       | Meaning in the interface                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `draft`      | Persisted documentation that has not been verified yet. |
| `verified`   | Normal active documentation.                            |
| `deprecated` | Content retained with an optional replacement target.   |
| `archived`   | Content retained for historical context.                |

A lifecycle `draft` is a real page and is not the same as a user's private editor draft.

Deprecated pages can point to a replacement path. The page view shows a lifecycle banner so readers can follow the replacement.

Administrators can apply status changes in bulk. Documentation health also reports draft and deprecated pages.

Deleted pages are not a lifecycle status. Deletion moves a page into the administrator recycle bin, where it can be restored or permanently deleted.
